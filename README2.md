Boostrapping in Julia: 

> Bootstrapping is a technique that uses resampling to test the diagnostics of a statistical measurement such as variance, standard error, cohen's distance, effect size, etc. 

> This code takes a random sample size of 100 observations from a known normal distribution, generates these samples of size 100, 1000 times and plots a convergence for the Statistical value of the sample size for each run of the iteration.
